The Blacksmith Giant Hammer is the best melee lightning weapon for an SL1
character. If you want, you can kill the Giant Blacksmith to collect his
Blacksmith Giant Hammer but only do so after you are certain you would not need
his services for the rest of your playthrough. In particular, he sells Twinkling
Titanites. Ensure you have at least Twinkling Titanite x 10 prior to killing the
Giant Blacksmith because you need those upgrade materials to fully upgrade the
Blacksmith Giant Hammer to +5. While the Blacksmith Giant Hammer+5 deals more
lightning damage than the Lightning Reinforced Club+5, note that the latter
weapon deals more physical damage.

You do not need to kill the Giant Blacksmith now for the purpose of stealing his
Blacksmith Giant Hammer. Wait until near the end of the game before you fight
Gwyn. In the meantime, the Lightning Reinforced Club+5 is sufficient for dealing
with bosses who are weak against lightning.
