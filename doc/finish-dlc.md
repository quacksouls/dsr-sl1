# Finish the DLC

You can now go fight Gwyn if you want to end your SL1 playthrough. For the sake
of completeness, you might want to defeat the remaining two bosses of the DLC.

## Oolacile Township

After defeating Artorias, light the Oolacile Township bonfire and do not consume
the Soul of Artorias.

## Lord's Blade Ciaran (optional)

An optional fight. The only reason to fight her is to obtain her armour set.
Ciaran also drops her weapons upon defeat, but you would not be able to properly
wield the weapons.

{% youtube id="cP26-pPq19A", title="89. Oolacile Township: locations of Crest Key & Silver Pendant, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Defeat Ciaran. Then explore the rest of the area to collect the Crest Key and
the Silver Pendant, both of which are related to the two remaining bosses of the
DLC. The Crest Key opens the door to the tower where Hawkeye Gough sits. Gough
will help you to initiate the fight against Black Dragon Kalameet. The key is
found within a Mimic. The Silver Pendant is a magic weapon that can deflect the
sorcery of Manus. The pendant is found inside a chest behind an illusory wall.
As you approach the wall, you will hear a pounding noise. Equip the Sunlight
Maggot and you should see an opening. Be vigilant while exploring the general
area because the enemies can one- or two-shot you. Another reason to be vigilant
is that Marvelous Chester will invade you. Other useful items to collect in the
area include:

-   Large Soul of a Proud Knight
-   Soul of a Brave Warrior x 2
-   Red Titanite Chunk. Found inside a chest, hidden behind an illusory wall. As
    you approach the wall, you will hear a pounding noise. Equip the Sunlight
    Maggot near the source of the noise and an opening would reveal itself.
-   Twin Humanities
-   Soul of a Hero

## Chasm of the Abyss

{% youtube id="jkPTXTuLgng", title="90. Chasm of the Abyss: White Titanite Slab, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

This is the best area in the game for farming Humanities. The Humanity Phantoms
have the highest Humanity drop rates in the game. The only item worth collecting
is the White Titanite Slab near the fog wall to the arena of Manus. You need
this slab to fully upgrade the Occult Reinforced Club to +5. Other useful items
to collect in the area include:

-   Humanity
-   Twin Humanities
-   Soul of a Hero

## Manus, Father of the Abyss (optional)

{% youtube id="a63osrANeLA", title="92. SL1 Manus, Father of the Abyss, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

One of the more difficult bosses in the DLC. Equip the Lightning Reinforced
Club+5 (or the Blacksmith Giant Hammer+5 if you have it) and trigger the effect
of the Red Tearstone Ring. Equip the Mask of the Child and the Grass Crest
Shield. Phase one is the easier phase. Avoid or roll through Manus' hand slam
and hand swipe attacks. Bait a jumping hand slam attack, or a delayed hand slam,
then R2. Phase two is the more dangerous phase of the fight. Manus will perform
three magic attacks. The first magic attack is when he charges his staff and
strikes it into the sky, after which a barrage of magic orbs showers upon you.
Sprint away from Manus and the orbs. The second magic attack is where Manus
charges his staff and impales it into the ground. A barrage of magic orbs wells
up from the ground and encircles you. Sprint to Manus and R2 and the orbs would
not hit you. The third magic attack occurs when Manus charges his staff and
shoots a volley of orbs directly at you. Dash or roll to the side. You can use
the Silver Pendant to deflect all of the above magic orbs. Like in phase one,
bait the hand slam and R2.

Defeat Manus and exhaust Dusk's dialogue. Revisit Elizabeth near the Oolacile
Sanctuary bonfire. Exhaust her dialogue and she would reward you with
Elizabeth's Mushroom x 3.

Go to the cliff above the arena of Kalameet. The dragon would fly above you.
Wait for the dragon to fly out of sight, then use the Crest Key to visit Gough.
Exhaust his dialogue and answer "Yes" to his questions. A cutscene would play
wherein Gough shoots down Kalameet, meaning that you can now fight the dragon.

## Black Dragon Kalameet (optional)

{% youtube id="w5IsuItXeVA", title="93. SL1 Black Dragon Kalameet, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

This boss is a colossal tank. Equip the Lightning Reinforced Club+5 or the
Blacksmith Giant Hammer+5 if you have it. Equip the Grass Crest Shield and the
Mask of the Child. Trigger the effect of the Red Tearstone Ring as follows. Use
the Symbol of Avarice to decrease your HP to about 622. Enter the fog wall and
drop down to the ledge where a Crystal Lizard can be found. Drop down again to
the floor of the arena and the effect of the Red Tearstone Ring would trigger.

Enter the arena and wait for Kalameet to walk into the fight. Bait the flying
thrust attack, dash underneath the tail, wait for Kalameet to slam its tail, and
R2. Rinse and repeat until the tail is cut. Another strategy is to be up close
to the dragon. Be by its side, bait the stomping attack, roll or move out of the
range of the attack, then R2. This strategy might sound dangerous, but it is
safer than trying to bait the flying thrust attack. Beware that Kalameet can
hover upward to breathe fire down on you. In that case, sprint away and wait for
the fire to dissipate. The boss might also perform a delayed charged attack to
position itself away from you so it can perform some of its fire and/or swipe
attacks.

{% youtube id="6l2BlKC21ng", title="94. Royal Wood after Kalameet: Twinkling Titanite x 2 & Titanite Slab, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Defeat Kalameet then collect the treasures within the arena. A chest can be
found behind a waterfall. The chest contains a Titanite Slab. Reload the area to
respawn the Crystal Lizard, which drops Twinkling Titanite x 2. Other useful
items to collect include:

-   Soul of a Brave Warrior x 2
-   Soul of a Hero
