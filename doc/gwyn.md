# Gwyn, Lord of Cinder

You are now near the end of your SL1 journey. One more boss remains to be
defeated. Before fighting the final boss, do whatever you need to do and
complete whatever quest line you need to complete. In particular, stock up on
consumables and upgrade materials. Upgrades and/or ascend weapons you want to
experiment in NG+1.

## Kiln of the First Flame

If you have not already done so, sit at the bonfire before the kiln and offer
the Lord Souls to open the gate to the kiln. Farm the Black Knights within to
stock up on Titanite Chunks and Blue/Red/White Titanite Chunks.

Equip the Chaos Reinforced Club+4 (a +5 is better if you have it) and have at
least 10 soft Humanities. Equip the Grass Crest Shield and the Mask of the
Child. Trigger the effect of the Red Tearstone Ring. The most effective strategy
against Gwyn is to parry his horizontal swing attacks. Enter the fog wall and
move in some distance toward Gwyn. Wait for him to perform a flying dash at you
and slash his sword. Parry the attack and riposte. Strafe behind Gwyn and R1.
Roll through his attacks as necessary. You can manipulate Gwyn into performing
the horizontal swing attack so you can parry and riposte. After strafing behind
Gwyn, drink from your Estus Flask and Gwyn would perform a horizontal swing of
his sword. Parry the attack and riposte. Rinse and repeat.
