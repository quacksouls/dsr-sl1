# Large Magic Ember

You are now ready to fight the last boss of the game, i.e. Gwyn. Before doing
so, you might want to grab the Large Magic Ember and/or enter the DLC.

The Large Magic Ember allows Rickert to ascend a magic weapon from +5 to +6. You
need Blue Titanite Chunks and a Blue Titanite Slab to fully upgrade a magic
weapon. Some bosses have magic as their weakest elemental defense:

-   Ceaseless Discharge. You can easily defeat this boss with any weapon or even
    your character's fist. You do not really need the Large Magic Ember to fight
    this boss. Should be already defeated.
-   Centipede Demon. Should be already defeated.
-   Ornstein, both regular and giant versions. Should be already defeated.

A magic weapon is effective against bosses you have already defeated. Grab the
Large Magic Ember in this playthrough to ascend various weapons to at least +6,
as preparation for later NG cycles.

Not planning on doing SL1 in NG+1? Then head straight to the DLC. Don't want to
do the DLC as well? Go to the Kiln of the First Flame to fight Gwyn and finish
your SL1 playthrough.

## Kiln of the First Flame

You should now be able to open the gates to the Kiln of the First Flame. Farm
the Black Knights within the kiln for these upgrade materials: Titanite Chunks
and Red/White/Blue Titanite Chunks. Upgrade your weapons in this playthrough as
high as possible so that in the next NG cycle you can max them out. The Black
Knights are easy to parry and backstab, but it is generally safer to backstab.

## The Duke's Archives

Return to the arena where you first encountered Seath at the top of his tower.
If you have been following Logan's quest line, he should appear in the arena.
Logan is now hostile towards you and will fight you as soon as you enter the
arena. Defeat Logan and grab the Large Magic Ember from the nearby wooden chest.
A Soul of a Great Hero can be found nearby.

## Sanctuary Garden

It is time to enter the DLC. Return to the location at Darkroot Basin where you
fought the golden Crystal Golem to rescue Dusk. You should see a dark vortex.
Interact with the vortex to be transported to Sanctuary Garden. Light the
bonfire and prepare to fight the area boss.

## Sanctuary Guardian (optional)

{% youtube id="WSG3tbC79mg", title="85. SL1 Sanctuary Guardian, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

This boss is weak against fire. Two-hand the Fire Reinforced Club+10. Equip all
items to boost your Stamina regeneration: Grass Crest Shield, Mask of the Child,
and Cloranthy Ring. Bait a swooping attack, roll out of the way, run to the
tail, and R2 to attack the tail. You want to cut off the tail as it can poison
you. Stay in front of the boss and move backward or roll to avoid its attacks.
Then R2 to quickly close the distance and get in a hit. Beware of the lightning
attack because it can linger quite a bit after hitting the water.

{% youtube id="hTmeRPEJ3oU", title="86. Royal Wood: Blue Titanite Slab & Elizabeth Mushroom, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Defeat the Sanctuary Guardian and enter the Oolacile Sanctuary to light the
nearby bonfire. Exhaust the dialogue of Elizabeth the giant mushroom and accept
her quest to rescue Dusk. Push ahead to the Royal Wood to grab a Blue Titanite
Slab. You will find mostly Wooden Scarecrows, which are easy to fight
one-on-one. Use the Longbow and arrows to lure each Wooden Scarecrow to you one
at a time. The enemies you should be wary of are the Guardians. These enemies
hit hard. Bait an attack and R2. The Blue Titanite Slab is found inside a chest
hidden within a bush and located on a small pool of water. Other useful items to
collect include:

-   Elizabeth's Mushroom
-   Soul of a Brave Warrior x 2
-   Large Soul of a Brave Warrior
-   Soul of a Proud Knight
-   Large Soul of a Proud Knight

## Knight Artorias (optional)

{% youtube id="ayL_t6WZTOo", title="87. SL1 Knight Artorias, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Always lock on to the boss. This boss has high resistance against all elemental
effects and is immune to all auxiliary effects. One way to deal high damage
output is to two-hand the Lightning Reinforced Club+5 and trigger the effect of
the Red Tearstone Ring. Equip the Mask of the Child and the Grass Crest Shield
to boost your Stamina regeneration. Artorias is aggressive. A window to safely
deal an R2 is after his jumping attack. He would crouch for a fraction of a
second, jump in the air, and impale his sword at you. As he crouches, dash
towards him and he would jump over your head and his attack would miss you. Then
R2 and back away. You should generally roll backward and away from his swipe
attacks. Artorias tends to perform a forward roll attack where he slams his
sword after performing a forward flip at you. Roll to your right and be prepared
for another flip, possibly two more, then R2. Another safe window to punish is
after his dashing thrust attack. He would dash towards you and thrust his sword.
Roll to your right, then R2. After depleting about a quarter of his HP bar,
Artorias would roll back two times to begin buffing himself. If you are close
enough, sprint towards him. R2 and an R1 should knock him out of his buffing
animation.

Defeat Artorias and light the Oolacile Township bonfire.
