# Northern Undead Asylum

In which you grab your pyromancer starting gears and break out of a sanatorium.

The beginning is no different from your first regular playthrough. Break out of
your jail cell and make your way to the first bonfire. Light the bonfire and
rest. Open the door to the arena of the Asylum Demon, but do not engage it yet
because you need to first collect your pyromancer starting equipment. Upon
entering the arena, head for the entrance that is diagonally to your left.
Another bonfire is located nearby. Light that bonfire and rest as necessary.
Exit via the other opening to collect the Cracked Round Shield and the Hand Axe.
The latter will be your weapon for the upcoming boss fight. Enter the fog wall,
descend a flight of stairs, and open a shortcut to the first bonfire. Use the
giant metal boulder to break a wall and speak to Oscar to receive your Estus
Flask and the Undead Asylum F2 East Key. Ascend a flight of stairs, open the
locked gate, and collect the Pyromancy Flame. Although this guide will not
discuss pyromancy strategies against bosses, you are still encouraged to use
pyromancy against regular enemies. The Pyromancy Flame allows you to cast
Fireball; use it whenever you need a ranged strategy against regular enemies.

## Asylum Demon

This tutorial boss is the same as any playthrough. Two-hand the Hand Axe and
initiate the fight by performing a plunging attack to drain the HP bar of the
boss by approximately one-third. The remainder of the fight is about positioning
your character behind the boss, get in one or two hits, and move outside the
range of the boss' attacks.

Defeat the Asylum Demon, open the door, and exit the arena to collect a Soul of
a Lost Undead. Let the giant crow carry you to Firelink Shrine.
