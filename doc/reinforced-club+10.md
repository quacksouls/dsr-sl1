# Reinforced Club+10

At this point in your playthrough, you cannot purchase Large Titanite Shards.
These upgrade materials must be farmed from the Giant Leeches in Lower
Blighttown. The enemies also drop Green Titanite Shards, useful for upgrading a
Reinforced Club along the Divine, Fire, or Magic path.

## Lower Blighttown

Start from Firelink Shrine. Use the Master Key to allow you access to the lower
portion of Blighttown. Have the Spider Shield ready to block the Infested
Barbarians and Blowdart Snipers. Also bring along some Purple Moss Clumps and
Blooming Purple Moss Clumps, all of which can be purchased from the Undead
Female Merchant. Use the Heavy/Light Crossbow and bolts to snipe the Giant
Mosquitos. Make a suicide run to grab the Fire Keeper Soul or play it safe and
snipe the Flaming Attack Dogs first. Useful items to pick up along the way:

-   Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier
-   Soul of a Proud Knight

Lower Blighttown has a bunch of Giant Leeches that can be used to farm for Large
Titanite Shards and Green Titanite Shards. You will need Green Titanite Shards
to upgrade a weapon along the Divine, Fire, or Magic path. Large Titanite Shards
are used in the standard upgrade path to upgrade weapons to +10. Have 10 soft
Humanities in your Humanities counter to increase your Item Discovery to 210.
Equip the Rusted Iron Ring to allow you to dash unhindered by the swamp. Here
are some useful items to collect in the area:

-   Large Soul of a Proud Knight x 3
-   Green Titanite Shard
-   Large Titanite Shard x 2
-   Poison Mist. Can be used to kill the red-eyed Chaos Bug that drops the
    Sunlight Maggot.
-   Tattered Cloth set. Collected along with Poison Mist. Boosts your fire
    defense.

Collect and/or farm at least Large Titanite Shard x 8 and use them to upgrade
the Reinforced Club+6 to +10. You should have bought the Weapon Smithbox from
Andre.

## Chaos Witch Quelaag

Two-hand the Reinforced Club+10 and buff it with Gold Pine Resin. Equip these to
help you survive an area-of-effect (AOE) blast: Tattered Cloth Manchette, Black
Leather Boots, Blue Tearstone Ring. Stay to the boss' side, not in front and not
behind. Use the R2 to close the distance and get in one hit. When the boss bends
down the upper half of her body and bobs her head, it means she is about to
perform her AOE blast. Run and/or roll away as far as you can to get out of the
range of the AOE. The delayed lava vomit gives you plenty of time to get in 2
hits.

Defeat Quelaag and ring the second Bell of Awakening. Descend the spiral
staircase and light the bonfire next to Quelaag's Sister. This bonfire will be
used later on to access Demon Ruins.
