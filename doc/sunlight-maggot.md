# Sunlight Maggot

The Sunlight Maggot is a head piece that provides a constant source of light.
The item is dropped by the red-eyed Chaos Bug at Demon Ruins. Having a source of
light is especially useful in the Tomb of the Giants, where it is almost pitch
black everywhere. The sorcery Cast Light can also be used to provide
illumination for 5 minutes and requires 14 Intelligence, stat that an SL1
character does not have. Like the Sunlight Maggot, the Skull Lantern provides a
constant source of light. However, you must equip the Skull Lantern in one hand
whereas the Sunlight Maggot frees both hands for the Grass Crest Shield and a
weapon. Obtaining the Sunlight Maggot early would also help to save Solaire from
going insane and trying to attack you. Overall, kill the red-eyed Chaos Bug, not
your sunbro `\[T]/`.

The Sunlight Maggot can also be used to obtain the Silver Pendant, an item found
in the DLC. While equipped, the Silver Pendant can be used to deflect magic
projectiles. The latter feature is especially useful against bosses who fire
magic at you. In particular, you might find the pendant useful during the fight
against Manus.

## Prowling Demon (aka Titanite Demon, optional)

This boss is optional. Reasons for fighting this boss include: (1) test your
mettle against a difficult mini-boss; (2) obtain some extra souls; (3) be
rewarded with Demon Titanite. As an SL1 character, you are unable to wield the
majority of weapons that can be upgraded with Demon Titanite. Of those items
that are upgraded with Demon Titanite, the only item you can properly wield
(both one- and two-handed) is the Crystal Ring Shield. If you still insist on
fighting this mini-boss, equip a 100% physical block shield and use the
Lightning Reinforced Club+4.

## Darkroot Garden

{% youtube id="wmdlqMUq8Zo", title="46. Locations of Wolf Ring & Enchanted Ember, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Let's visit Darkroot Garden to collect various items. First on the list is the
Wolf Ring. The ring grants you 40 Poise so you would not stagger when taking a
hit from various enemies. As an SL1 character, you cannot afford to tank hits,
meaning that the Wolf Ring is almost useless for the playthrough. The next item
to collect is the Enchanted Ember. Give the ember to Rickert and he would be
able to upgrade your weapons along the enchanted path. An enchanted weapon deals
magic damage, useful against bosses such as Ceaseless Discharge, Centipede
Demon, and Ornstein (both phases). Useful items to collect along the way:

-   Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier x 2
-   Soul of a Proud Knight
-   Large Soul of a Brave Warrior
-   Soul of a Brave Warrior

The next boss is optional. The main reason for defeating the Moonlight Butterfly
is to collect the Divine Ember which, together with the Dark Ember, is required
for upgrading a weapon along the Occult path. You should already have the Occult
Club when you collected Havel's armour set at Anor Londo. In case you want an
Occult Reinforced Club, then fighting the Moonlight Butterfly is mandatory.

## Moonlight Butterfly (optional)

{% youtube id="2A7xSn6PGbc", title="47. SL1 Moonlight Butterfly & Divine Ember, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Fighting this boss is all about waiting for an opportunity to attack. The boss
constantly hovers above you and occasionally perches on the bridge to give you a
window to attack. Use some kind of ranged attacks while the boss is hovering,
e.g. Throwing Knife, (Black) Firebomb, Light Crossbow and bolts. When the boss
perches on the bridge, two-hand the Lightning Reinforced Club+4 and R2 it to
death.

## Anor Londo

{% youtube id="9B2jLAmoLaU", title="48. SL1 Cheese the Prowling Demon at Anor Londo, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

In case you need to collect Demon Titanite for some purpose, defeat the Prowling
Demon at Anor Londo. This mini-boss is easy to cheese. Have at least 80 Black
Firebombs; about 71 are enough. Purchase Black Firebombs from the Crestfallen
Merchant at Sen's Fortress. Start from the bonfire where you saw Solaire
sitting. Run up the circular staircase, turn left into a room, and go to the
balcony above the Prowling Demon. Throw Black Firebombs at the demon until it is
defeated.

## Demon Ruins

{% youtube id="qiXh1iqAVvI", title="50. How to get Sunlight Maggot by using Poison Mist, Dark Souls: Remastered" %}{% endyoutube %}

Start from the Daughter of Chaos bonfire. Donate Humanity x 30 to Queelag's
sister to allow you to open the shortcut at Demon Ruins. Run to the bonfire
where a Burrowing Rockworm originally spawned. From there continue down the
flight of stairs and be in front of the fog wall to the arena of the Demon
Firesage. Do not enter the boss room. Instead, turn right and gingerly traverse
the path along the tree root and you should see a gigantic gate, in front of
which are various Chaos Bugs. Interact with the gate and it would open a
shortcut to Lost Izalith. Find a red-eyed Chaos Bug and kill it. The bug should
drop the Sunlight Maggot. You can also kill the bug from behind the gate. Attune
Poison Mist and Toxic Mist. Run to the gate, then cast Poison Mist followed by
Toxic Mist. The mist should reach the red-eyed Chaos Bug. Wait for the bug to
die. Either open the shortcut now (provided you have already donated Humanity x
30 to Queelag's sister) or wait until after you have defeated the Centipede
Demon. In any case, Solaire would not be able to collect the Sunlight Maggot,
thus you would have saved him from going insane.
